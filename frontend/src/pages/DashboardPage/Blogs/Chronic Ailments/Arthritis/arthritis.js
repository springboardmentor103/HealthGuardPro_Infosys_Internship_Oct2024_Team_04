      <h1>Understanding Arthritis</h1>
      <p>
        Arthritis is a term used to describe a group of over 100 medical
        conditions that affect the joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness,
        and reduced mobility. It is one of the leading causes of disability
        worldwide and can significantly impact the quality of life.
      </p>

      <h2>What Causes Arthritis?</h2>
      <p>
        The causes of arthritis vary depending on the type, but common factors
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Age:</b> Wear and tear on joints increases with age.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Genetics:</b> Family history can play a role in conditions like
          rheumatoid arthritis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Infections:</b> Certain infections can trigger arthritis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Injury:</b> Joint injuries can increase the risk of osteoarthritis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Immune System Dysfunction:</b> Autoimmune conditions like
          rheumatoid arthritis occur when the immune system attacks joint
          tissues.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Arthritis</h2>
      <p>
        There are several types of arthritis, each with unique characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Osteoarthritis (OA):</b> The most common form, caused by wear and
          tear of joint cartilage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):</b> An autoimmune disorder causing
          inflammation in the joints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Psoriatic Arthritis:</b> Occurs in people with psoriasis, an
          inflammatory skin condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gout:</b> Caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints,
          often affecting the big toe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Juvenile Arthritis:</b> Affects children and teens, causing joint
          pain and swelling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms of Arthritis</h2>
      <p>Common symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joint pain and stiffness, especially in the morning or after rest.</li>
        <li>Swelling in one or more joints.</li>
        <li>Reduced range of motion.</li>
        <li>Redness and warmth around the affected joints.</li>
        <li>Fatigue and general discomfort (common in autoimmune arthritis).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Arthritis is diagnosed through a combination of medical history,
        physical exams, and tests such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Blood Tests:</b> To detect markers of inflammation and autoimmune
          disorders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Imaging Tests:</b> X-rays, MRIs, and ultrasounds to assess joint
          damage and inflammation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Joint Aspiration:</b> Analysis of fluid from the affected joint.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        While there is no cure for arthritis, treatments focus on managing
        symptoms and improving joint function. Common approaches include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Medications:</b> Pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and
          disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for autoimmune forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Physical Therapy:</b> Exercises to strengthen muscles and improve
          joint mobility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Lifestyle Modifications:</b> Weight management, joint protection,
          and a healthy diet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Assistive Devices:</b> Braces, splints, and mobility aids to
          support joints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Surgery:</b> Joint replacement or repair for severe cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        While some forms of arthritis cannot be prevented, the following
        measures can reduce the risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain a healthy weight to reduce stress on joints.</li>
        <li>Stay physically active to strengthen muscles and joints.</li>
        <li>
          Protect joints during physical activities with proper techniques and
          equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like fruits,
          vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids.
        </li>
        <li>Manage chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Living with Arthritis</h2>
      <p>
        Arthritis can be challenging, but a proactive approach can improve
        quality of life. Regular exercise, stress management, and a supportive
        network of family, friends, and healthcare providers are essential.
