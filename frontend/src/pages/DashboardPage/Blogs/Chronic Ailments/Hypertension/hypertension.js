      <h1>Understanding Hypertension</h1>
      <p>
        Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition where the force of the blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. It is a major risk factor for serious health complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Hypertension?</h2>
      <p>
        Blood pressure is the measurement of the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of the body's arteries. It is expressed in two numbers: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Systolic Pressure:</b> The pressure when the heart beats and pumps blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Diastolic Pressure:</b> The pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure readings consistently exceed 140/90 mm Hg, though the threshold may vary depending on individual circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of Hypertension</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension can be classified into two types based on its cause:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Primary (Essential) Hypertension:</b> This form has no identifiable cause and develops gradually over time due to genetic and lifestyle factors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Secondary Hypertension:</b> This type is caused by an underlying condition such as kidney disease, hormonal disorders, or certain medications.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Various factors can increase the risk of developing hypertension:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Family history of hypertension.</li>
        <li>Age, with higher risk in individuals over 40.</li>
        <li>Obesity or being overweight.</li>
        <li>Unhealthy diet, particularly high sodium and low potassium intake.</li>
        <li>Lack of physical activity.</li>
        <li>Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.</li>
        <li>Chronic stress.</li>
        <li>Medical conditions such as diabetes or sleep apnea.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms of Hypertension</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension is often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no noticeable symptoms. However, in severe cases, individuals may experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Severe headaches.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
        <li>Nosebleeds.</li>
        <li>Blurred vision.</li>
        <li>Chest pain or irregular heartbeat.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>
        Untreated hypertension can lead to serious health complications, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heart disease, such as heart attacks or heart failure.</li>
        <li>Stroke and brain damage.</li>
        <li>Kidney damage or failure.</li>
        <li>Vision loss due to damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.</li>
        <li>Aneurysms caused by weakened blood vessels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention and Lifestyle Management</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension can often be prevented or managed through lifestyle changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain a healthy weight and adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.</li>
        <li>Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day and increase potassium-rich foods.</li>
        <li>Engage in regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.</li>
        <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption.</li>
        <li>Manage stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or therapy.</li>
        <li>Monitor blood pressure regularly and attend health check-ups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        When lifestyle changes are not enough to control hypertension, medical treatment may be necessary. Treatment options include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Medications:</b> Common medications include diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combination Therapy:</b> Sometimes, multiple drugs are used to achieve better blood pressure control.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Treatment is highly individualized, and close monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension is a common yet serious condition that can significantly impact quality of life if left unmanaged. Through a combination of lifestyle changes, medical treatment, and regular monitoring, individuals with hypertension can effectively control their condition and reduce the risk of complications.
