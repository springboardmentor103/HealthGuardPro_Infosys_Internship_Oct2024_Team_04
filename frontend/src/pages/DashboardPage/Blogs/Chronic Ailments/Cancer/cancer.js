      <h1>Understanding Cancer</h1>
      <p>
        Cancer is a broad term for a group of diseases characterized by the
        uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. It can
        develop in almost any tissue or organ and can invade or spread to other
        parts of the body if not treated.
      </p>

      <h2>What Causes Cancer?</h2>
      <p>
        Cancer is caused by changes, or mutations, in the DNA within cells.
        These mutations can disrupt normal cell function, leading to
        uncontrolled cell division. Several factors can contribute to these
        mutations, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
         <b>Genetics</b>: Inherited mutations from family history may predispose
          individuals to certain types of cancer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Environmental Factors</b>: Prolonged exposure to carcinogens such as
          tobacco, radiation, and certain chemicals.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Lifestyle Factors</b>: Smoking, poor diet, lack of physical activity,
          and alcohol consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Infections</b>: Viruses like HPV, Hepatitis B, and Epstein-Barr virus
          can increase cancer risk.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Cancer</h2>
      <p>
        Cancer can be classified into several types based on the tissue or cell
        type where it originates. Some common types include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Carcinomas</b>: Cancer that begins in the skin or tissues lining
          internal organs, such as breast, lung, or colon cancer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sarcomas</b>: Cancer arising from bone, cartilage, fat, or muscle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Leukemias </b>: Cancer of the blood or bone marrow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Lymphomas </b>: Cancer that affects the lymphatic system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors </b>: Cancers affecting the central
          nervous system.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms of Cancer</h2>
      <p>
        Symptoms vary depending on the type and location of cancer, but general
        warning signs include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
        <li>Persistent fatigue</li>
        <li>Chronic pain</li>
        <li>Unusual lumps or swelling</li>
        <li>Changes in skin, such as new moles or sores that do not heal</li>
        <li>Persistent cough or difficulty swallowing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis and Staging</h2>
      <p>
        Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Diagnostic methods
        include imaging (CT scans, MRIs), biopsies, and blood tests. Staging
        helps determine the extent of cancer's spread, guiding treatment
        decisions. Common stages are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stage 0: Cancer is localized and hasnâ€™t spread.</li>
        <li>Stage I-III: Cancer has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.</li>
        <li>Stage IV: Cancer has metastasized to distant organs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Although not all cancers can be prevented, many risks can be minimized
        through lifestyle changes and regular screenings. Preventive measures
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.</li>
        <li>
          Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
        </li>
        <li>Maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active.</li>
        <li>Getting vaccinated for viruses like HPV and Hepatitis B.</li>
        <li>Scheduling regular cancer screenings, especially for high-risk individuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
      <p>
        Cancer treatment depends on the type, stage, and individual factors.
        Common treatments include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          **Surgery**: Removing the tumor and surrounding tissue to prevent
          further spread.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Radiation Therapy**: Using high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Chemotherapy**: Drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Immunotherapy**: Boosting the immune system to fight cancer.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Targeted Therapy**: Drugs that target specific genes or proteins in
          cancer cells.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Living with Cancer</h2>
      <p>
        A cancer diagnosis can be life-altering, but many individuals live
        full, meaningful lives during and after treatment. Support from
        healthcare providers, family, and community resources plays a vital
        role. Managing side effects, maintaining mental health, and following a
        healthy lifestyle are key to improving quality of life.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Cancer is a complex disease, but advancements in research and treatment
        have led to improved outcomes and survival rates. Awareness, prevention,
        and early detection are the best tools for combating cancer and
        improving public health.
